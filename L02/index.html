            In the Religious Studies Center website each individual article or
            story is linked closely together. They are separated by white space
            that is a different color than the cards that link to each article.
            A picture, the date it was published, and the first few lines of the
            article are included in each card, followed by white space on all
            sides. The white space is of a different color which makes it easier
            to distinguish. It also makes each article just a little further
            apart, making it obvious that each contains a different topic, idea,
            element, etc.Balance, one of the key principles of design, refers to 
            the way visual elements are arranged so that their visual weight 
            harmonizes with the other elements in the design, and the composition 
            gives an appearance of properly distributed elements.

        <h2>Contrast</h2>

          <p>
            The design principle contrast refers to the use of visually different elements. 
            In addition to capturing attention, contrast can guide t he viewer’s eye to a 
            focal point, highlight important information and add variety, or even drama, 
            to a design. Paired with other principles like proximity, it can really drive 
            a design’s message home. In theory, applying contrast is simple. All you need 
            to do is use opposite or different elements: color, size, shape, texture, value… 
            you can play with any of these visual elements to achieve contrast. But in 
            practice, it’s a little trickier. Knowing when to use contrast and which elements 
            to oppose isn’t always obvious. That’s where this guide comes in.

            Throughout the Smithsonian website one can find examples of great
            use of alignment, but especially towards the bottom of the homepage
            were everything is centered over one another. The pictures, headings
            and short descriptions are all stacked one above the other and
            centered. Just above this section the pictures are still centered;
            however, the headings and the text are all justified to the left.
            This along with the color change makes it obvious that the section
            is changing and, therefore, the content and focus is changing as
            well.
